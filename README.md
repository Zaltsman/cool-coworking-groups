## Let's build together! 

This is an app meant to encourage more co-working communities to exist and flourish around the world. More co-working groups means more building which means more learning and connecting. It was also an excuse to play with Supabase at the [Select Hackathon](https://hackathon.supabase.com/)) at Y Combinator on Oct 4, 2025. 

The next step for this app will be to use it as inspiration and bring it to production on [PostHog's website](posthog.com).  

## About the app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The database is running on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
